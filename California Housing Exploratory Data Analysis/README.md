## Project Name: California Housing exploratory data analysis
Prediction of median house prices for California districts derived from the 1990 census.
For this analysis we use the California Housing dataset found on the Kaggle Data Repository at the following location:

California Housing Prices

The objective of the analysis is to predict median house prices in different regions of California as per the 1990 census data.

We hope to gain valuable insights by following this process. The various steps in the process can be elaborated on as follows:

Load data

Clean data
Missing values
Outliers
Erroneous values

Commentary
This dataset is used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow' - highly recommended!

## Short description: 


## General Information: 


## Conclusion / Results
Based on this simple EDA and model accuracy results we can confirm that location is a very strong predictor of house prices indeed. An R-squared of 73% is a very strong indication of strong correlation between location and house price . This is however not a surprise as everyone know that it is all about: "location, location, location"!

In our next notebook we will do some more EDA and investigate correlation patterns with other variables. We will then build some predictive models using Pipelines. Cannot wait!
