## Project Name: Covid-19 Vaccination Visualizztion
 As a Covid warrior I would like to really analyze the COVID-19 data visualization.


## Short description: 
Finding the hidden information and create wonderful visualization. As part this project I have used power BI tool to create visualization. 

## Observations
1. The first visualization [1] is about the case rate of 14 days by continent. It clearly states that Europe has the top in a number of cases in the last 14 days. The Fourth visual shows the hospital beds per thousand cases. Europe is top at the number of hospitals and bed availability. The country handled as well as they make the hospital so quickly to help people. Within two months (Feb and March) they really worked hard to make the hospital and availability of beds.
2. The Second visualization [2] Population by continent shows the most occupied population continent is Asia and other continents have almost same population density.
3. The Third visualization [3] shows the number of tests done by each country in Europe and the cases found.
4. The Fifth visual shows the number of cases in 2020 vs 2021. Though European countries have vaccines available still there is not much improvement in the cases. I would say the 2021 year is more problematic than 2020. Covid-19 second wave and third wave are brutal.
5. The Sixth visual shows the number of cases and death rate by each
 
## Overall design choice:
I used Power Bi as visualization tool. Now I am really a fan of Power Bi. I used the COVID-19 worldwide dataset. Lets go through each visualization and understand it.
1. [1] Stacked area chart
Data source used for this visualization is case rate of 14 days by continent (Data-on-14-day-notification-rate-of-new-COVID-19-cases-and-deaths dataset) [1].
Color pallets used-
Green – Total cases by continent.
2. [2] Pie chart
Data source used for this visualization is Population by continent (Data-on-14-day-notification-rate-of-new-COVID-19-cases-and-deaths dataset) [1]. This graph represents population by continent.
## Color pallets used-
Yellow – Population in Asia
Purple – Population in Africa
Red – Population in Europe
Sky blue – Population in North America
Orange – Population in South America
Black – Population in Oceania
3. [3] Line chart
Data source used for this visualization is tests done and new cases for European countries (Data-on-testing-for-COVID-19-by-week-and-country) [1]. This graph represents Total cases and total deaths by country. Used filters to clear graphs. Changed the color combinations for uniformity of dashboard.
## Color pallets used-
Green – Total tests by country.
Blue – Total cases by country.
