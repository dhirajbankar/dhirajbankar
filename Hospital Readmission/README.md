## Project Name: Hospital Readmitance predictive model
Hospitals have a challenge.  Their challenge is about patients, resources, and ultimately better control of their costs.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19917405/122685833-83888900-d1d3-11eb-8c11-1ddebd565de6.png)


## Short description: 
Having better understanding and control of when a patient may need readmittance within a 30 day cycle can help mitigate these challenges.  
When a patient needs to be readmitted it puts added stress on the overall infrastructure from people, processes and systems and this ultimately increases the institutions costs.

Today we plan to outline machine learning models that can assist these institutions with a better way to predict those individuals more likely to require readmittance.
