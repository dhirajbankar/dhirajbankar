## Project Name: Insurance charges prediction
There are two major research questions: -
Predict the insurance charges based on the customer feature data that help to Identify the key features responsible for the making a decision on insurance charges

Benefits: -
The benefits of analyzing this data include: -
Personally, I will gain experience using the prediction models. On the industry side, the model will be really useful for them if it can precisely predict the insurance price
Finally, I am a health care domain person and this dataset will give me an opportunity to explore my data science skills in this area


## Short description: 
I choose to go with the insurance dataset. Given my old healthcare domain background, I want to explore a predictive model-based dataset and the current dataset provided me the necessary scope required for the project.

## Conclusion / Results
•	Insurance dataset was successfully analyzed with a goal to predict the insurance charges 
•	There is a total of 6 attributes considered for this analysis such as Age, Sex, BMI, Number of children, Smoker and Region.
•	There was a total of 3 types of predictive models built i.e. Multiple Linear Regression, polynomial regression and Random Forest Regression
•	The accuracy of the models between three models were very comparable. Within the three models, the polynomial regression has a slightly better accuracy
•	Overall, a good predictive model was built with an accuracy of about 85% that is able to predict the insurance charges of the customers.
•	The accuracy would have been much better if the dataset were to have more of instances.
